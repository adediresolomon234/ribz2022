                Been close friends with Ibrahim since 2012, going wayyy back to college, all the way through university, it’s been very interesting seeing my guy grow to the point where he was ready to settle down, if you knew the Ibrahim I knew, you’d know that it would take a very very special lady to take him off the market and along came the lovely bride to be Ramat, the only lady that could’ve taken my guy off the streets and she did it so effortlessly, which says a lot. Here’s to the beautiful and happy couple 🥂

                On this special sunny day in 2016, a certain married man had a lot of mouth claiming he was the best at FIFA, so as men we had a small bet - the winner gives the other a haircut or beard cut. Bare in mind Ibra and I were new friends.  - I won 5-1 and had the pleasure of cutting his hair. He got so upset he didn’t speak to me for a week, he also jumped out from a moving cab but it was the start of our friendship. That day proved that he was a man of his words and 4 years later, countless of memories and marriage. He bacame one of my closest sbs boys.

                My bro bro, to have a supportive brother gives me great happiness, to see you get married is double happiness. From the moment I saw you and Rahmat on snap, I knew there was something special, and it is great to witness the relationship blossom over the years. With determination and resilience, both of you have made it work despite the long distance relationship. Can’t wait for the 25th of June, we are about to go live!!!

                it's an honour to be here today to not only  cleebrate love, but  God willing (in sha Allah) many more years of  this partnership which mky brother,ibrahim has joined. People spend years seacrching  for love  and it  gives me great joy to witness one so sweet as i stand here with you all today. i have known ibrahim foe more years that my own fingers can count and seeing him become not only a wonderful man but now also a husband is honestly a blessing. i can't say it will be easy but as you both continue to grow together, i pray for nothing but joy and bliss,good health,more love, more money! And two boys! i could be here all day speaking about this wonderful man but as we can all see beside every wonderful man .... is a wonderful woman. Wishing you all the best, thank you

                Ramat and Ibz! Hmmmm…they are the true definition of “long distance love works”.
                I met rammie in uni and irrespective of the attitude I gave her on the very first day, she has always been the sweetest girl with little or no drama, little entanglements and almost insignificant love story at the time, fast forward to when she met ibz who has stopped at no cost to make her happy (which I am very grateful for). Rammie is too caring, she’s always there for me, always ready to listen, non judgmental. I could go on and on but e don do! 
                
                Ibz, met him playing PS while we were rushing to go mark favor’s birthday, I had heard about his gaming Shinanigans but that day I knew he was addicted 🤣.
                Our London naira Marley, easily gullible(he falls for unserious jokes 😂) but he’s the life of the party and money sprayer 🤣
                
                I am very glad your paths crossed amidst all the arguments, misunderstandings and all, you guys made it thus far and have many more years to go. 
                
                I pray God makes this Union blossom in love, good health and joy. I pray you have offsprings that’ll experience your love individually and together. Love you guys!

                Hi, excuse me. Is this how you talk? Were the words that accompanied a tap on my shoulder, Nov 11, 2013. 
                Some minutes before that, I had approached this good looking young lady with a couple of her friends seeking direction to see the 100level adviser for Agric. Edu. University of Ilorin. Fortunately for me, we were there to see the same person. So we hung around, exchanged numbers and got talking from there. 
                This soul, Rahmat, since then has been more than a friend to me. She’s loving, sweet, ready to listen and give her 2Cent, can be mischievous sometimes, beautiful both IN & OUT, smart, a definition of Ride or Die…
                I remember when ‘Mat told “US” there’s this guy she’s talking to now and she thinks it’s serious. We asked for pictures and approved then gave our blessings. 
                Ibz is one fun to be person. No dull moment when he’s around. And I like when he speaks Yoruba with BRIHISH accent. Thanking you for making my friend happy and not making us regret our decision. 
                We love you plenty❤️
                I love you endlessly BOLUMORE❤️❤️

                I am still shocked my Rammy boo is getting married but it makes me so glad and I can not thank Almighty God enough for this blessing.
                I have known Rahmat for more than a decade and I must say she happens to be one of the sweetest person you would ever come across although I must add the fact that she’s extremely dramatic and always scared of the littlest things like crossing the road (lol). We have shared so many amazing memories together which I would forever cherish.
                Rahmat is a very kind person, a great cook I must add because I am always lobbying around when she makes her special Efo and Fried rice ( it’s safe to say I am a friend for food… just kidding).
                Meeting Ibsz, is the happiest I have seen my Rammy and I pray that the both of you make each other happy till the end of time. I pray God blesses the both of you with amazing babies that you will never have a cause to weep over except it is tears of joy. I pray God will make the institution of marriage easy for both of you. Once again, I congratulate both of you and I wish you a very happy married life.
