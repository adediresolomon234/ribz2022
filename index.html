          <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
          <p class="our-story">
            Rahmat and Ibrahim met through their friend Debby (Ibrahim friends wife and Rahmat's 
              friend/cousin) through a group call in which Debbie and her friend were teasing Rahmat. 
              Debby told Rahmat she had a friend for her from the UK who was coming to Nigeria in December 
              and told Ibrahim that she had found him a wife. During this call, socials were exchanged and thus
               began their beautiful story. 
            
          </p>
         
          <p class="our-story">
            Messages were sent, and conversations were not as regular as both would have liked as Ibrahim was 
              busy working during the days. Still packing during the evenings for his trip to Nigeria, Rahmat was 
              very understanding and patient with Ibrahim. However, their communication became better once Ibrahim landed in Nigeria, they spoke every day, and that is how Ibrahim realised how caring, thoughtful, and selfless Rahmat was. Ibrahim felt that his days in Nigeria would not have been complete without speaking to Rahmat.
              Looking forward to meeting the girl who has now captured his attention and hers, they both decided and planned to meet on the beach on the 22nd of December. Meeting for the first time, Ibrahim's family were sceptical of his travel arrangements to Lagos as he has been to Nigeria in a long time, but he preserved and travelled to Lagos from Ibadan to meet his girl. Ibrahim was excited on his way to meet Rahmat and couldn't wait to see Rahmat. On arrival, Ibrahim called Rahmat and asked if she could pick him up from 
              the entrance to the beach as he didn't know the place too well. When Rahmat arrived to pick up Ibrahim,  Ibrahim could not believe how beautiful and was mesmerised. Ibrahim wondered how she could be so beautiful inside and out, and they walked by the beach. Shortly after meeting, Ibrahim tried climbing some rocks at the beach, which Rahmat could not stop laughing as it was the most dramatic and funniest thing she had ever seen. Rahmat took out her phone and recorded Ibrahim while still laughing till tears came out, and at that point, Rahmat and Ibrahim knew that they had found their one and only. They later walked further along the beach, and that is when Ibrahim asked Rahmat to be his girlfriend, and to his surprise, she said yes, although sceptical at first. 
              Although they did not spend much time together in the lagos, Ibrahim travelled back to Ibadan and then back to London. However, they maintained their daily communication and thus began their long-distance relationship, and their friends can hardly remember times when they were not on the phone together. Although Ibrahim had plans to go travel back the following year, the pandemic happened, and he couldn't; and not seeing each other for a year and not knowing when they would see each other again, Ibrahim planned with the help of his friends and hers, to propose to Rahmat in February 2021.

                My bro bro, to have a supportive brother gives me great happiness, to see you get married is double happiness. From the moment I saw you and Rahmat on snap, I knew there was something special, and it is great to witness the relationship blossom over the years. With determination and resilience, both of you have made it work despite the long distance relationship. Can’t wait for the 25th of June, we are about to go live!!!

                Been close friends with Ibrahim since 2012, going wayyy back to college, all the way through university, it’s been very interesting seeing my guy grow to the point where he was ready to settle down, if you knew the Ibrahim I knew, you’d know that it would take a very very special lady to take him off the market and along came the lovely bride to be Ramat, the only lady that could’ve taken my guy off the streets and she did it so effortlessly, which says a lot. Here’s to the beautiful and happy couple 🥂

                On this special sunny day in 2016, a Ibzs had a lot of mouth claiming he was the best at FIFA, so as men we had a small bet - the winner gives the other a haircut or beard cut. Bare in mind Ibra and I were new friends.  - I won 5-1 and had the pleasure of cutting his hair. He got so upset he didn’t speak to me for a week, he also jumped out from a moving cab but it was the start of our friendship. That day proved that he was a man of his words and 4 years later, countless of memories and marriage. He bacame one of my closest sbs boys.

And two boys! i could be here all day speaking about this wonderful man but as we can all see beside every wonderful man .... is a wonderful woman. Wishing you all the best, thank you

                Ramat and Ibz! Hmmmm…they are the true definition of “long distance love works”.
                I met rammie in uni and irrespective of the attitude I gave her on the very first day, she has always been the sweetest girl with little or no drama, little entanglements and almost insignificant love story at the time, fast forward to when she met ibz who has stopped at no cost to make her happy (which I am very grateful for). Rammie is too caring, she’s always there for me, always ready to listen, non judgmental. I could go on and on but e don do! 
                
                Ibz, met him playing PS while we were rushing to go mark favor’s birthday, I had heard about his gaming Shinanigans but that day I knew he was addicted 🤣.
                Our London naira Marley, easily gullible(he falls for unserious jokes 😂) but he’s the life of the party and money sprayer 🤣
                
                I am very glad your paths crossed amidst all the arguments, misunderstandings and all, you guys made it thus far and have many more years to go. 
                
                I pray God makes this Union blossom in love, good health and joy. I pray you have offsprings that’ll experience your love individually and together. Love you guys!

                Hi, excuse me. Is this how you talk? Were the words that accompanied a tap on my shoulder, Nov 11, 2013. 
                Some minutes before that, I had approached this good looking young lady with a couple of her friends seeking direction to see the 100level adviser for Agric. Edu. University of Ilorin. Fortunately for me, we were there to see the same person. So we hung around, exchanged numbers and got talking from there. 
                This soul, Rahmat, since then has been more than a friend to me. She’s loving, sweet, ready to listen and give her 2Cent, can be mischievous sometimes, beautiful both IN & OUT, smart, a definition of Ride or Die…
                I remember when ‘Mat told “US” there’s this guy she’s talking to now and she thinks it’s serious. We asked for pictures and approved then gave our blessings. 
                Ibz is one fun to be person. No dull moment when he’s around. And I like when he speaks Yoruba with BRIHISH accent. Thanking you for making my friend happy and not making us regret our decision. 
                We love you plenty❤️
                I love you endlessly BOLUMORE❤️❤️

                I am still shocked my Rammy boo is getting married but it makes me so glad and I can not thank Almighty God enough for this blessing.
                I have known Rahmat for more than a decade and I must say she happens to be one of the sweetest person you would ever come across although I must add the fact that she’s extremely dramatic and always scared of the littlest things like crossing the road (lol). We have shared so many amazing memories together which I would forever cherish.
                Rahmat is a very kind person, a great cook I must add because I am always lobbying around when she makes her special Efo and Fried rice ( it’s safe to say I am a friend for food… just kidding).
                Meeting Ibsz, is the happiest I have seen my Rammy and I pray that the both of you make each other happy till the end of time. I pray God blesses the both of you with amazing babies that you will never have a cause to weep over except it is tears of joy. I pray God will make the institution of marriage easy for both of you. Once again, I congratulate both of you and I wish you a very happy married life.

                Incomingggggggg…… Lol

                Dear Ramat & Ibrahim.
                
                Looking back to when Ramat was single and now, I’m just so glad the difference is freaking clear!! It’s even more fulfilling to be part of this union and to witness all of it.
                I haven’t met Ibsz yet but not withstanding, from the way my friend (the bride) has been happy ever since everything started, it’s a sure evidence that he a very wonderful man no doubt, I meannnnnnn, look at Ramat’s glow lol.. 
                This couple have actually given a totally different opinion about distant relationship, they have corrected that myth that distant relationship is a scam cause a lot of people do not believe in it.
                Time flies so fast that we don’t even notice it…let me say how happy I am for you guys, you found the perfect arms to be yours forever and always. Or better said, you found each other. You found true love, the one worth dying for. It’s amazing to see so much love intertwined with friendship. Because you truly are best friends.
                Your faces never seem to be lacking a smile. When I see your pictures, I know that is what real love looks like.
                Over the many years ahead where you will share in each other's joys and times of difficulty that life brings, i wish for you that your love for each other only creates a glue which strengthens the bond with age (like a good wine, maturing and just getting better and better!).
                As you guys prepare for your big day, remember to take it all in slowly. Take in every kind word, congratulations, the flowers, the emotions, the love from people near and far, the dress and all the craziness that comes with it, for sometimes we can get caught up in a world wind of schedules and appointments; instead, appreciate and enjoy all these special moments. I know it will be such a happy day! As you go on with all the wedding planning, please remember to have fun with it and most importantly remember this day is about you both and no one else.
                
                Dear Ramat,
                
                I’m so glad you found the one who makes your heart and soul happy. I seriously couldn’t have handpicked anyone better for you than him. I see the way you light up when you are around him, the way you smile when his name is mentioned, and how excited you are when you talk about your future together. I am so excited to watch you marry the love of your life, the man God molded just for you. I have no doubt that the next journey that life has for you two, together, will be nothing less than an amazing adventure. The day you say “I do” you are not two people; you become one. One journey, one purpose, one marriage. You both are an example of an amazing couple grounded in God’s love and word. Together you will conquer mountains and get through valleys. Also, remember every step you all take you are following the steps God has ordered for you!
                So here is to the exciting next few months as we get ready for your fairy tale that you will tell your kids about. I’m so proud of you and all you have achieved so far. I cannot wait to watch you two embark on your greatest adventure yet.
                
                
                All my love,

                I met Rahmat at an ex friends birthday dinner about 7/8 years ago and we clicked ever since ,liked her immediately cos we looked so alike and I admire her behavior and character.
                I met her hubby on one occasion where he was trying to surprise Rahmat ,and I can testify he’s such a good,kind and caring man , because asides being Rahmat’s husband ,he has shown concern during hard and low moments 
                God bless your union ,I wish you both the very best life has to offer and love you both so dearly😘

                I remember my first day in Uni like it was just yesterday, i was so clueless and all I could think to myself was “omo how  will i survive” because of how shy i was,lol. Rahmat was the first friend i made and i met her on my first day in school. I couldn’t stop calling her for every activity we had because i was l grateful I finally found a partner, little did i know i found a partner for life.You know when couples say it was love at first sight, that was how our friendship felt. 

                Rahmat is the sweetest, caring and most thoughtful person you can ever imagine. She’s my best girl and my best friend. She’s the one person that’s always ready to listen to all your troubles, lol. I’m sure she’s so tired of me right now. I’m so glad that all our dreams are finally coming true.
                
                Seeing how far your relationship has come from that video call(when debby introduced you guys) to now, I couldn’t be more happier.
                The way you both love each other is so amazing. The way you both made “long distance relationship “ look so easy is worth learning. These two can drive one into depression if you’re single lol, because the way they love each other and are always on video call 24/7(like how do you guys do it) one might be jealous. I’m so happy you both found each other and you complete each other. You two are a perfect match.
                       Dear Ibrahim, thank you for making my babygirl super happy. This is the happiest I’ve seen her. When i look back at when rahmat was single, the difference is evident. Thank you for spoiling her silly and understanding her perfectly. The way you love her, omg, I don’t think anyone else could have done better. 
                  
                I pray that as you both have decided to spend your lives together, may Allah bless your union. May He ease all your affairs, may love, laughter and joy never cease in your home. May Allah grant you both sabr( patience) to overcome every situation. May Allah grant you guys righteous and pious children, amin.
                
                I’m so glad i get to do life with you two❤️.
                With love,

                Hmmm, where can I start from? I met Ibrahim back in 2016 through my husband ever 
                since then he became family & my amebo partner & also my daughter’s favourite uncle.
                 I became friends with Rahmat in 2017 & ever since then she also became family. When 
                 Ibz was telling my husband that he wanted to be serious & wanted a wife, I thought of 
                 rahmat straight away because she has so much good morals & I knew ibz would love her, 
                 so I didn’t hesitate to do matchmaking and I am happy & proud that I matched them up 
                 because look at us now!!! WE ARE GETTING MARRIED. I knew once they met they would 
                 connect straight away because they are the same in someways, both have sharp mouth ,
                  once you insult one of them the other one attacks you, very stupid couple but I am 
                  blessed to have both of you in my life. May the love you both have for each other never 
                  die down, your house shall always be full with happiness, I can’t wait for you guys to start 
                  having kids, hopefully you kids don’t carry ibz head cause OMOO that head is solid. May God bless
                   your union. I love you both❤️

                Nysc Orientation camp, was my first time of meeting Ramat….. 
                we got connected quickly within that 3 weeks  like we’ve known each 
                other for a life time, we luckily got posted in the same secretariat, few
                blocks from each other and literally lived toghther during that Nysc years,
                this made our bond stronger and grew found of each other cos we basically see 
                ourselves everyday…. 
                Along the phrases of life….. As we grew older we went apart for a while, stopped
                communicating and lost our friendship but she reached out first to settle our 
                differences, she kept checking up and put our friendship in check  which she still 
                do ……. Ramat is a very sensitive person that can tell and know when something is off 
                and she’s always ready to sort it out…….. Met my sweet brother through her (Ibrahim), 
                this is one of the sweetest soul I’ve come across, always in a happy mood, have 
                something to joke about and make you laugh, randomly calling to check up……… The couple 
                are more of a family than friends and I wish them the sweetest Marriage and every source
                of joy and happiness this union got to over ❤️

                So I met Rahma through one of my favorite person and we kicked it off from there. She became my one and only fashion designer and we became even closer. Rahma introduced me to ibsz (my brother in shayo) at their introduction party and he has been my G since then. 
                I’m so glad to be friends with the couple and I wish them a beautiful home❤️❤️
